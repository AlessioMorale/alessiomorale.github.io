    title: "Alessio Morale - Who Am I?"
---

Software engineer by trade, currently working with robotics simulations.
Electronics, programming and "making stuff" have been my favorite hobbies since forever.

In 2010 I discovered by chance the world of multirotor and UAVs.
Initially, they just were simple Arduino based projects, but soon
moved to some other advanced platforms.

At the beginning of 2012, I started collaborating with the OpenPilot
project and later, in 2015, co-founded with several of its former
developers, the LibrePilot project (www.librepilot.org) as firmware
and architecture lead.

Recently I'm interested in several other topics, including mobile
robotics, <a href="https://www.ros.org">ROS</a>, products design,
3d printing and home automation (I'm lazyðŸ™‚)

Some of the projects I'm currently working on are
<a href="/projects/slammer/">Slammer</a>, a rover robot and 
<a href="/projects/unav2/">uNav2</a>, an advanced motor control board for robots
