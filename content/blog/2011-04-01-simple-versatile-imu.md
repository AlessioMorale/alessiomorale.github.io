I'm working on a simple way build a IMU that is easy expandable with new sensors.

What come out was this simple system:

several 20x20mm blocks that could be easily interconnected.

By now i have only build the [Logic level translator](levelconv.pdf)/3.3v regulator block and a gyro/accelerometer board based on itg3200 and bma180.

Here are the pictures of the buiding process.
