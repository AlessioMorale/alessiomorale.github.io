I was waiting for my props (they had an odyssey thanks to Poste Italiane, a long story worth a whole post'), than i saw an old bluetooth GPS, useless nowadays.

Than i ripped apart the GPS(hopefully it will be used in the quad someday), modded a little and attached to the Quad Arduino.

I only had to change the MultiWii firmware to slow down serial speed to 32800 (I haven't found documentation of the module to change the speed).

In some days i should receive a new module bought from Ebay( Sure Electronic) that's able to support 115200, that i will integrate into the main board.

Now I can use the MultiWII interface for short range remote telemetry on the quad, very useful for setup the PID.

Here is the pic:
